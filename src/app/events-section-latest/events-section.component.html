                <h3>5. Retirement Party</h3>
                <p>
                  Retirement only comes around once, so it makes sense that you‘d want to throw a big party 
                  for your loved one when it‘s their turn to move on.
                   Traditionally, retirement parties involve close friends, family members and colleagues. 
                   Venues are either your home or a restaurant. 
                   For the most part, there‘s nothing wrong with this particular approach,
                    but it‘s not overly exciting either.
                     If you really want to escort your loved one into retirement in style,
                      why not book them a private cruise boat in Goa for the party?
